   Hi my name is Aisha Muse.The Game I created is Dice Duel. Dice Duel is a two-player game where two players bet against each other on who will have a higher dice roll number . Once bets are made players roll the dice to know who will receive their bet and who will lose their bet!

Tech Stacks I used to create this game are :

Node.js
Express
Javascript
Html
and css

Three main features I have on the website are My player1 and player2 inputs where players put ther number (1-10) "bets" in . My 'New Button" Feature which restarts the game without having to restart the server  and My "Roll The Dice" Feature which rolls the dice to show the dice roll numbers in a alert.
